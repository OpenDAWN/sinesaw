FLOW OF AUDIO DATA

- SongBridge creates a Worker, webaudio scriptprocessor node, and tracks
  playback position.  It creates an initial zeroed buffer.

- SongBridge receives updated song state from ui app on change, passes state to
  worker

- on audioprocess SongBridge passes its existing buffer to the scriptprocessor
  node and sends a message to the worker requesting a new filled buffer

- The worker receives buffer messages, creates new filled buffers and transfers
  them back to the main thread

- SongBridge recieves incoming buffers and keeps them until the next
  audioprocess event


FLOW OF MIDI MESSAGES

- MidiInput recieves values, keep track of current note state for ui

- SongBridge binds to MidiInput onMessage and passes messages to the audio
  thread

- Song recieves midi messages,  keeps them in a list and passes them to tracks
  at tick rate.. it clears the list for every buffer.

- Tracks combine midi on/off messages with note on/off from sequences and pass
  to instruments as notesOn / notesOff arrays at tick rate

- Instruments keep track of current notes in their own way, use to generate
  audio
