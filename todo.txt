pre launch:

- update basic sampler
  - drag to zoom
    - zoom centers around mouse x position
    - pan left / right w/ cursor
    - drag determines if action is initially a zoom or pan, works unidirectionally
  - sample start / loop on sample view
    - add loop to basic sampler model
    - disabled button state
    - highlight waveform to show selected area w/ a different color
    - draggable markers (Marker component, rendred by Waveform, array of marker data passed as prop to Waveform)
  - record modal (add a generalized modal function to app)

- add loop slicing sampler
  - global pitch / volume envelope
  - global filter
  - waveform slicing ui w/ zoom

- add instrument keyMap() function to drum sampler and loop sampler, pass to piano roll to display rows only for mapped drums (piano roll has toggle button for this, if this is not available piano roll has 2 selects to choose root note and scale, can fold into those)

- automation
  - velocity
  - make some way to have props on models calculated including automation
  - add automation ui.. experiment w/ sweep / lfo generators

- update analog synth
  - filter lfo

- test current approach vs using web audio nodes
  - each note adds a new node w/ scheduled playback, param changes

- if not going w/ multiple nodes approach, fix playback marker to show time independent of buffering

- look at using webmidi (would need to update instruments to work w/ note on / note off instead of note recieveing length at note start)

- ability to save
  - account creation
  - sample storage limit / price

- sample import from youtube soundcloud

post launch:

- update basic sampler
  - add start / end / loop controls

- plugin format / plugin import from github

- piano roll
  - fix note positions when mouse is dragged past edge of piano roll and piano roll autoscrolls
  - show loop size like ableton, make view size independtent of loop size, make dragging notes expand view size
  - try to reproduce bug where option key is stuck on
  - try to reproduce bug where cursor gets stuck on

- effects
  - add effects busses
  - add insert effects
  - reverb
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/simple-reverb
  - delay
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/delay
  - compression (w/ sidechain)
  - distortion
    - http://component.fm/#components/web-audio-components/overdrive

- add fm synth

- rethink ui: 'live' view? arrange view?
