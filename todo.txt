BUGS:

- bug removing track where piano roll width doesn't update

- bug where noteend exactly at the end of a sequence is never sent

- figure out missing transitionend event

- after stopping audio and then restarting, sometimes get a chunk of white noise
  before audio plays normally - seems like its coming from drum synthesizer, but
  not 100% sure about that. (dividing by a very small number? something to do w/
  fm?)

- playback marker can get stuck moving after audio is stopped

- can scroll down in piano roll one key at a time, up only by two keys (wtf?)

- piano roll not resizing when track is removed


FEATURES:

- move sample data out of cursor structure into some global library so that
  samples can be shared w/o data being duplicated

- sample selection ui with preset samples (use a modal, user can chose existing
  sample that is already part of song, chose to load a preset one, or chose to
  upload a new one)

- better handling of allocation of objects containing mutable state for tracks
  and instruments when they are added or removed - song should do this as part
  of update method instead of tracks doing it for themselves in `tick`.. it can
  compare old against new tracks to see what has changed

- WRITE UNIT TESTS for dsp / midi stuff - try to figure out a good way to test
  interprocess communication

- better cleanup in cursor cache

- webrtc collaboration (and ui for it)

- add velocity to notes, piano roll


- ability to save
  - ui to sign up, manage tracks, manage account
  - backend (cors so site can be hosted on s3)
    - postgres on amazon rds
    - /account POST PUT
    - /session POST DELETE
    - /songs GET POST
    - /songs/:id GET PUT DELETE
    - /samples POST DELETE
  - sample storage limit
    - identify files by digest
    - conect files to users w/ join model

- piano roll
  - when a note is placed on top of another note they should merge
  - fix note positions when mouse is dragged past edge of piano roll and piano
    roll autoscrolls
  - show loop size like ableton, make view size independtent of loop size, make
    dragging notes expand view size
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where option key is stuck on
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where cursor gets stuck
  - copy / paste

- renamable tracks and items in list view

- add swing to grid in piano roll

- add 'off' to quantization options

- add instrument keyMap() function to drum sampler and loop sampler, pass to
  piano roll to display rows only for mapped drums (piano roll has toggle button
  for this, if this is not available piano roll has 2 selects to choose root
  note and scale, can fold into those)

- automation
  - velocity
  - make some standard way to have props on models calculated including
    automation / midi
  - add automation ui.. experiment w/ sweep / lfo generators.  this is an area
    where this room for improvement over ableton

- add loop slicing sampler
  - global pitch / volume envelope
  - global filter
  - waveform slicing ui w/ zoom

- update analog synth
  - mappable lfo

- plugin format for instruments and effects + plugin import from github

- effects
  - add effects busses
  - add insert effects
  - reverb
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/simple-reverb
  - delay
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/delay
  - compression (w/ sidechain)
  - distortion
    - http://component.fm/#components/web-audio-components/overdrive

- add fm synth

- rethink ui: add live style clip view? add logic style arrange view?
