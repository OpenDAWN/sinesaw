pre launch:

I am in the middle of adding filters to the basic sampler instrument, then planning
on converting the analog synthesizer instrument

- finish audio conversion to be purely functional
- keep track of time that play was pressed so that playback starts in the right
  place, click once on piano roll to move playback marker (need play, pause,
  stop methdods on Song)
- turn tracks back into an array
- better handling of allocation / deallocation of objs for notes / filters in
  instruments when tracks are added / removed
- try doing processing in background thread, passing buffers
- move sample data out of cursor structure

- ability to save
  - backend (cors so site can be hosted on s3)
    - postgres on amazon rds
    - /account POST PUT
    - /session POST DELETE
    - /songs GET POST
    - /songs/:id GET PUT DELETE
    - /samples POST DELETE
  - sample storage limit
    - identify files by digest
    - conect files to users w/ join model

post launch:

- piano roll
  - when a note is placed on top of another note they should merge
  - fix note positions when mouse is dragged past edge of piano roll and piano
    roll autoscrolls
  - show loop size like ableton, make view size independtent of loop size, make
    dragging notes expand view size
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where option key is stuck on
  - try to reproduce / fix bug where cursor gets stuck on
  - copy / paste

- renamable tracks and items in list view

- add swing to grid in piano roll

- add 'off' to quantization options

- look at using webmidi (need to update instruments to work w/ note on / note
  off instead of note recieveing length at start)

- add instrument keyMap() function to drum sampler and loop sampler, pass to
  piano roll to display rows only for mapped drums (piano roll has toggle button
  for this, if this is not available piano roll has 2 selects to choose root
  note and scale, can fold into those)

- automation
  - velocity
  - make some standard way to have props on models calculated including
    automation / midi
  - add automation ui.. experiment w/ sweep / lfo generators.  this is an area
    where this room for improvement over ableton

- add loop slicing sampler
  - global pitch / volume envelope
  - global filter
  - waveform slicing ui w/ zoom

- update analog synth
  - mappable lfo

- plugin format for instruments and effects + plugin import from github

- effects
  - add effects busses
  - add insert effects
  - reverb
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/simple-reverb
  - delay
    - https://github.com/web-audio-components/delay
  - compression (w/ sidechain)
  - distortion
    - http://component.fm/#components/web-audio-components/overdrive

- add fm synth

- rethink ui: add live style clip view? add logic style arrange view?
