pre launch:

- add instrument keyMap() function to drum sampler and loop sampler, pass to piano roll to display rows only for mapped drums

- update basic sampler
  - buttons for upload / record
  - record modal (maybe add a generalized modal function to app)
  - sample start / loop on sample view

- update analog synth
  - filter lfo

- automation
  - make some way to have props on models calculated including automation
  - add automation ui.. experiment w/ sweep / lfo generators

- add loop slicing sampler
  - global pitch / volume envelope
  - global filter
  - waveform slicing ui w/ zoom

- test current approach vs using web audio nodes
  - each note adds a new node w/ scheduled playback, param changes

- if not going w/ multiple nodes approach, fix playback marker to show time independent of buffering

- look at using webmidi (would need to update instruments to work w/ note on / note off instead of note recieveing length at note start)

- ability to save
  - account creation
  - sample storage limit / price

- sample import from youtube soundcloud

post launch:

- update basic sampler
  - add start / end / loop controls

- plugin format / plugin import from github

- piano roll
  - fix note positions when mouse is dragged past edge of piano roll and piano roll autoscrolls
  - show loop size like ableton, make view size independtent of loop size, make dragging notes expand view size
  - try to reproduce bug where option key is stuck on
  - try to reproduce bug where cursor gets stuck on

  - add insert effects
  - reverb
